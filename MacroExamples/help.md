You can paste the contents of these files into your macro editor or download them and move them to your macros folder.

You can find the macros folder in the settings and clicking Open Macro Files. This is how you can also share your macros with your friends easily. However, note that if you have mouse movements, etc, they may not line up on your friend's screen if you do not have the same monitor resolutions.

Refer to the help content in the macro tab, found in the settings menu, for all functions of what you can do with the macro editor
